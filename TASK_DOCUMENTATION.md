# Task 4 Documentation

This document outlines the steps taken to complete the Git version control task.

1.  Initialized a local Git repository.
2.  Created a remote repository on GitHub and pushed the `main` branch.
3.  Created a `.gitignore` file to ignore logs and env files.
4.  Created a `README.md` file for the project.
5.  Implemented the branching strategy: `main` -> `dev` -> `feature/add-task-docs`.
